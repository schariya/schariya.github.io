I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Coordinated Science Lab at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I work with [Olgica Milenkovic](https://csl.illinois.edu/directory/faculty/milenkov). 

My primary research interest is in machine learning involving network data and graph-based algorithms. I am also more generally interested in connections between deep and classical methods.

I received my PhD in computer science at UMass Amherst, where I was fortunte to be advised by [Cameron Musco](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~cmusco/). I also interned for two summers at Adobe Research, where I was mentored by [Ryan Rossi](http://ryanrossi.com/) and others. Prior to graduate school, I studied computer science and engineering physics at Dartmouth College.
