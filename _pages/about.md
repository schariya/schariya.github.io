I am a fourth-year PhD student in computer science at UMass Amherst. I am advised by [Cameron Musco](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~cmusco/).

My primary interest is in machine learning involving network data and graph-based algorithms. My recent work centers around learning or inverting low-dimensional representations for networks. I am also more generally interested in connections between recent, “deep” methods and classical methods.

In Summer 2021, I interned at Adobe Research, where I was mentored by [Ryan Rossi](http://ryanrossi.com/) and others.
