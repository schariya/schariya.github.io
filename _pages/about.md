I am a PhD candidate in computer science at UMass Amherst, where I am advised by [Cameron Musco](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~cmusco/).

My primary interest is in machine learning involving network data and graph-based algorithms. I am also more generally interested in connections between deep and classical methods.

In Summer 2021 and Summer 2022, I interned at Adobe Research, where I was mentored by [Ryan Rossi](http://ryanrossi.com/) and others.
