I am a research scientist at Meta. I completed a PhD at the University of Massachusetts, where I worked with [Cameron Musco](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~cmusco/) on machine learning for graph data. I also interned for two summers at Adobe Research and did a brief postdoc at the University of Illinois before moving into industry. Prior to graduate school, I studied computer science and engineering physics at Dartmouth College.
